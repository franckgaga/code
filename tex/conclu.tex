\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduced the \texttt{ModelPredictiveControl.jl} package, a free and open-source package for advanced process control in Julia. It relies on \texttt{ControlSystems.jl} and \texttt{JuMP.jl}, two powerful frameworks for computer-aided control system design and mathematical optimization, respectively. The new state estimator and predictive controller types are designed to be easy to use, clear and modular. The main features of the package were described and illustrated with two case studies. The package is still under active development and contributions are welcome. Short-term developments will focus on implementing a moving horizon estimator for state observation under constraints.

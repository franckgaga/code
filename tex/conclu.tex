\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduced a free and open-source package for advanced process control design in Julia. It relies on \texttt{ControlSystems.jl} and \texttt{JuMP.jl}, two powerful frameworks for computer-aided control system design and mathematical optimization, respectively. The new state estimator and predictive controller types are designed to be easy to use, clear and modular. The main features of the package were described and illustrated with two case studies. A benchmark comparison with the equivalent MATLAB toolbox exposes its computational efficiency, without any code generation, and thus avoiding the two-language problem. The package is still under active development and contributions are welcome. Short-term developments will focus on adding the support of custom nonlinear constraints based on a user-defined function. Recent developments on abstraction interfaces to automatic differentiation libraries could be also integrated to facilitate the testing of other approaches like reverse- or mixed-mode.

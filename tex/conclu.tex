\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduced the \texttt{ModelPredictiveControl.jl} package, a free and open-source package for advanced process control in Julia. It relies on \texttt{ControlSystems.jl} and \texttt{JuMP.jl}, two powerful frameworks for computer-aided control system design and mathematical optimization, respectively. The new state estimator and predictive controller types are designed to be easy to use, clear and modular. The main features of the package were described and illustrated with two case studies.\added{ A benchamark comparison with the equivalent MATLAB toolbox expose its computational efficiency, without any code generation, and thus avoiding the two-language problem.} The package is still under active development and contributions are welcome. Short-term developments will focus on implementing \replaced{estimators in the current form to eliminate the one-sample time delay when possible.}{a moving horizon estimator for state observation under constraints}. \added{Recent developments on abstraction interfaces to automatic differentiation libraries could be also integrated to facilate the testing of other approches like reverse- or mixed-mode.}
